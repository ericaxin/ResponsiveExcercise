In front of my desk is a large window facing south. During the day, it brings in direct sunlight and brightens up the whole room.
<p>The squirrels and birds outside the window can be a real distraction during class sometimes.</p>
<p>Recently it’s been getting dark so much earlier. Around 5 pm, the sun dips below the horizon and the fleeting colors of dusk begin to fade away. I wonder if there will be a pretty sunset today.</p>
